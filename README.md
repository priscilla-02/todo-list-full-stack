# To-do List üìù

## Welcome üëãüèª

---

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application with a front-end server developed using React.js/Next.js and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS. The backend RESTful API is designed with Express.js in Node.js and written in TypeScript.

This setup utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering and static generation capabilities on the frontend, and leverages the Express.js framework for API development and backend logic. The backend employs Prisma as an ORM tool for MySQL databases, facilitating smooth database operations, migrations, and schema management. Additionally, it integrates Zod for validating incoming request payloads within Express.js routes, ensuring robust data integrity and effective error handling. A simple unit-testing demo for the backend is demonstrated using the Jest testing library as an example.

## User Functionality

After successful registration and login with authentication, users can:

**Create To-Do Lists** Add items to their to-do lists.
**Mark Items as Complete/Incomplete:** Toggle the status of to-do list items.
**Delete To-Do List Items:** Remove items from their to-do lists in a secure environment.
